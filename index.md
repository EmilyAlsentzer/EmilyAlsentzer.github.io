Hello! My name is Emily Alsentzer, and I'm a first year PhD student in MIT's Health Science and Technology (HST) Program. This page is currently under development, but I plan to use it as a medium for discussing research and the future of machine learning in healthcare. Check out my CV [here](https://github.com/EmilyAlsentzer/EmilyAlsentzer.github.io/CV_11_29_17.pdf).
